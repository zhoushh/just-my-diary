## 15th Feb

We have been celebrating the Lunar New Year here in China. Traditionally, the festival starts from the 8th of the 12th lunar month (13 Jan 2019 this year) and ends at the 2nd of the 2nd lunar month (8 March 2019 this year). And the main part starts from the 23rd/24th of the 12th lunar month to the Lantern Festival (15th of the 1st lunar month), that would be 28/29 Jan to 19 Feb. In China Mainland, the bank holiday usually lasts for seven days, from the new year's eve to the 6th of the 1st lunar month.

There're three of my personal goals this year, which we call it a _flag_ in Oral Chinese(yes, exactly the English word...).

1. Start my open source project named prac-jap (hope i could make it..)
2. Get CCNA certification
3. Pass JPTL N3

Wish me good luck...
